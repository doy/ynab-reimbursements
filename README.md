# ynab-reimbursements

## Overview

This is a tool to help reconcile reimbursable transactions in YNAB. Since YNAB doesn't support this itself, I've had to build a fairly idiosyncratic workflow around this, so the things this app does might not be super useful to anyone else. In particular, it requires that you have a budget category called "Reimbursables" that all of your reimbursable transactions are placed in, and that you don't use flag colors for anything important, because it treats green as "reimbursed" and anything else as "not reimbursed".
